# EdgeTx-lua-scripts
Written and tested only on a Jumper T-Pro V2 (oled LCD)

~~With the RSSI Model Locator.lua file Add also the two audio files. Eventually replace telemko.wav with the one in your own language.~~ 
Now uses language from SYSTEM folder and auto detect user language. The beep is generated rather than being a file, so other files other than the lua file are no longer needed.
